      <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
      <p class="aboutme">Hi as you may know my name is Sam Watson <br>
After being a motorcycle mechanic for 10 years and dreaming of doing something different i finally decided now is the time. I packed my bags and left sunny old England! <br>
From there i spent the next 4 months travelling south east Asia. After finishing my travels around Asia, i spent a year and a half living and working in Australia.<br>
The fun couldn't last forever and once the fun had stopped and i had to return home i decided that i would like to study coding and become a web developer.</p>
